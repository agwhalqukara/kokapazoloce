But to be able to cope favorably, one may have to be forced to grow into the role, even when in disguise. This is the case with Mor Shapiro, Ben Shapiro’s wife.</p><p>Ben is a renowned political analyst, public figure, and media host. He has been known for his conservative views on politics and is an attorney of the law. This implies that he is not most people’s favorite person and has very few friends close to him, like his wife Mor, due to his controversial views on politics. Mor Shapiro started being known when her husband started referencing her in his shows and interviews, which got fans curious about her and what she does.</p><h2><strong>Profile Summary of Mor Shapiro</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Mor Shapiro</li><li><strong>Year of Birth</strong>: 1988</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 35 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Herzliya, Israel</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 5 feet 4 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 134 lbs</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Medical doctor</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Jewish</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac sign</strong>: Carpricorn</li><li><strong>Spouse</strong>: Ben Shapiro</li><li><strong>Children</strong>: Leeya Eliana (daughter) and son (undisclosed name)</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Mor Shapiro?</strong></h2><p>Mor Shapiro is 35 years old. She was born in 1988 in Herzliya, Israel. Mor Spent the first 12 years of her life in Israel before her family migrated to the United States of America, where she resumed her education.</p><p>She attended Sha’arei Mishpat College before she came to California. She then proceeded to study psychobiology at the University of California and later earned her Medical Degree at the School of Medicine at UCLA. Mor also worked as an instructor on clinical skills while she was studying.</p><h2><strong>What is Mor Shapiro’s Ethnicity and Nationality?</strong></h2><p>Mor Shapiro is Israeli-Moroccan and Jewish and has both American and Israeli nationalities. She was born in 1988 in Herzliya, Israel, into a Jewish family originally from Morocco. At the age of twelve, she migrated to Sacramento, California, with her family. She’s declared many times that she’s Jewish by religion.</p><p>Aside from this, no other information exists about Mor’s childhood or even her parents, but we learned she started having a passion for medicine at a very young age.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/pjimage-7.jpg alt width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><b>What Does Mor Shapiro Do For a Living?</b></h2><p>Mor Shapiro is a medical doctor. She is been certified as a Physician and has been involved in a two-year research in developmental neuroscience. The research was all about examining the brain’s developmental stages during early childhood with the aid of MRI.</p><p>Mor currently works as a medical practitioner on women and behavioral health. She has worked at the Department of Family Medicine at the University of California and the Foundation Hospital in Fontana, California. She’s also the founder of the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) at the University of California. Her drive as a promoter in bioethics drove her passion for the job, which eventually became an annual event.</p><h2><strong>What is Mor Shapiro’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Mor Shapiro has a net worth of between $1 million to $5 million. Despite not being as famous as her husband, Mor Shapiro is quite successful and has made a name for herself as a physician. She’s reported to earn an annual salary of $294,000, which is what has contributed to her net worth. She may also have made lucrative investments in the stocks of different companies.</p><p>When you add her wealth to her husband’s, you can see that they have done well for themselves as a family. There are no official reports on other work that she does. Apart from practicing medicine, she has made a solid impression, not tied down to just being a celebrity’s wife. This has earned her massive respect from her otherwise controversial and allegedly misogynistic husband.</p><h2><b>Mor Met Ben Shapiro in 2007</b></h2><p>Mor met her husband through his younger sister, Abigail Shapiro. She was an opera singer at the time, and that was where they met each other. Abigail was also a renowned opera singer who became close friends with Mor. It wasn’t long before she introduced Mor to her brother Ben, and they hit it on instantly in 2007. Mor was still a student at UCLA at the time of their meeting.</p><p>Their relationship was so great that Ben decided to take it up a notch by getting her engaged just three months later. The engagement was so swift that people were amazed at the speed it happened, considering Ben’s controversial record as a misogynist.</p><h2><strong>They Got Married in 2008 and Now Have Two Kids&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Ben Shapiro and Mor Shapiro tied the knot in a Jewish ceremony in 2008, a year after they started dating. Mor was 20 at the time, while Ben was 24. It’s safe to say that Mor’s marriage to such a popular and controversial figure as Ben Shapiro brought her to the limelight as she’s usually a very private person who was relatively unknown in the social space.</p><p>Ben Shapiro has often mentioned his wife and has declared that she is a devoted wife who offered to transfer to medical school for the sake of their marriage. Ben declined the offer and offered to move his job instead, and today, they have raised a lovely family together. The marriage between the two resulted in the birth of two children. Their first child, a daughter named Leeya Eliana, was born in 2014, while their second child, a boy, was born in 2016. His name is yet to be made public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/pjimage-7.jpg><h3><strong>Marriage and Relationship Timeline</strong></h3><table><tr><th>Year/Date</th><th>Event</th></tr><tbody readability=3><tr><td>2007</td><td>Engaged to Ben Shapiro</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>Married Ben Shapiro</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2014</td><td>Birth of their first child, a daughter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2016</td><td>Birth of their second child, a son</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Mor Shapiro Has Been Drawn into Her Husband’s Controversial Views</strong></h3><p>Mor Shapiro came under the limelight in August 2020 concerning her husband’s statement on Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s song known as WAP. The political analyst <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>controversially read the song’s lyrics</a> much more in admiration than in disdain, and the song includes words like “Wet a p***,” which is a word that is used to describe the female genitalia. This happened during the August 10 airing of The Ben Shapiro Show. There were so many other vulgar inferences that he listed from the song that many women felt very uncomfortable with.</p><p>He famously added, “This is what the Feminist movement was all about: women being treated as independent, full, rounded human beings. It’s about wet a** p-word. And if you say anything differently, it’s because you’re a misogynist. I think we’re still confused about the intention of his comments before he dropped another statement through a tweet that his physician’s wife diagnoses women like those mentioned in the “WAP” song as having “bacterial vaginosis.” Ben received massive backlash on social media for those tweets, and the mention of his wife made people curious about her and what she thinks about his misogynist nature.</p><h3><strong>Mor Keeps Calm Despite the Attention Ben Shapiro Has Been Bringing to Her</strong></h3><p>On the other hand, Mor Shapiro is a very private person and does not often share her opinion publicly. She is a feminist who has been interested in women’s affairs and health. Despite the controversial nature of her husband, Mor has not let herself lose any control by speaking publicly, especially after the comments Ben made about Cardi B’s WAP. From all indications, it seems Mor focuses on helping out in women’s affairs as a feminist rather than lashing out on social media about them. She has never been caught making comments about her husband’s views on women, which confirms that she is not a social media person.</p><p>In conclusion, it is glaring to see that Mor Shapiro has earned her mark without any association with her famous, controversial husband. She has managed to be a family woman and a career-driven personality quite wonderfully. Her husband Ben may not change from being what he is, but Mor has done enough to attract respect despite not being a social person.</p><h2><strong>FAQs About Mor Shapiro</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Ben Shapiro’s wife, Mor Shapiro?</strong></h3><p>Ben Shapiro’s wife is Mor Shapiro, a medical doctor originally born in Israel in 1988.
