However, he proved his worth and became one of the most sought-after guitarists.</p><p>Hence, a successful career of one’s favorite musician always triggers a question, ‘What is Dweezil Zappa’s net worth? Another most common interest is that if Dweezil is more prosperous than his father, Frank Zappa? Read until the end to find out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dweezil_Zappas_Net_Worth_And_Earnings></span>Dweezil Zappa’s Net Worth And Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Well, Dweezil Zappa’s net worth has increased to $4 million, thanks to his musical career.</p><p>Born in a Zappa family on September 5, 1969, in LA, he pursued a career in music in 1986. He further chose a nickname, Dweezil, given to him by his father. Moreover, Zappa has been affiliated with over five record labels.</p><p>Thus, let’s look into Dweezil Zappa’s earnings from his entertaining career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_Musical_Career></span>Earnings From Musical Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As previously mentioned, Dweezil started his career in the mid-80s and is associated with five labels.</p><p>Zappa is well-versed in playing several instruments, including bass, piano, banjo, and vocals. To date, he has released five solo albums since 1986 and has worked with many renowned musicians.</p><p>Thus, Dweezil Zappa’s earnings from his album sales are magnificently massive, which has supported him live a convenient lifestyle.</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Album Name</th><th>Audio/CD/MP3</th><th>Vinyl/Cassette</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Confessions</td><td>$17.84</td><td>$4.89</td></tr><tr><td>Havin' a Bad Day</td><td>$95</td><td>$99.99 / $16.25</td></tr><tr><td>My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama</td><td>$58.98</td><td>$6.96</td></tr><tr><td>Via Zammata'</td><td>$16.62</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Go with What You Know</td><td>$13.98</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Automatic</td><td>$7.99</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Likewise, Zappa collaborated with his brother, Ahmet Zappa, and released two albums under a band named Z.</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Album</th><th>Audio CD</th><th>Vinyl</th><th>Audio, Cassette</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Shampoohorn</td><td>$6.88</td><td>$199.98</td><td>$14.98</td></tr><tr><td>Music for Pets</td><td>$99.99</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Moreover, Dweezil Zappa also led a tribute act as the oldest son of American musician Frank Zappa, Zappa Plays Zappa. The show was dedicated to performing the music of his father. Moreover, in 2012, Dweezil released the album Zappa Plays Zappa and Return of the Son, which costs $7.98 and $12.55.</p><p>Frank Zappa’s son, Dweezil’s choice to pay tribute to his late father, became somewhat controversial, which led to an estate battle between the siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dispute_Regarding_Trademark></span>Dispute Regarding Trademark<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aforementioned, the band that led the tribute act for Frank Zappa by Dweezil Zappa debuted in 2006.</p><p>Furthermore, Zappa Plays Zappa also won Best Rock Instrumental Performance of the Frank Zappa instrumental classic, Peaches en Regalia.</p><p>However, in April 2016, Dweezil Zappa announced that he’d be changing the band’s name to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa. The announcement came after family tensions over the use of the term arose. The Trust’s lawyer later told Dweezil that ‘Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa’ infringed on the Trust’s trademarks for ‘Zappa’ and ‘Frank Zappa.’</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Dweezil Zappa (@dweezilzappa)</a></p><p>Moreover, in 2016, he held a tour to celebrate the 50th year of the release of Zappa’s first album, Freak Out!. Thus, Zappa defiantly re-named the tour, “50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants – The Cease and Desist Tour.”</p><p>Interestingly, the Zappa siblings got dragged into an estate dispute for decades after Frank’s widow, Gail, chose not to leave her four surviving children equal shares. She further left 30% to<strong> Ahmet Zappa</strong> and <strong>Diva Zappa</strong> while also making them co-trustees. On the other hand, Dweezil and <strong>Moon Unit</strong> only received 20% and were not named trustees.</p><p>The battle finally settled until March 2019, when an LA judge approved a settlement agreement between three of four kids. However, Moon Unit was not a part of the settlement. Furthermore, the settlement also states that the income generated by the performance of Frank’s music must be split four ways.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_Acting_Career></span>Earnings From Acting Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Besides making money from a musical career, Dweezil Zappa’s net worth is also influenced by his occasional acting career.</p><p>According to Dweezil <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Zappa’s IMDb</a>, Zappa has 20 acting credits, most of which are television series. He has appeared in Metalocalypse, On the Spot, According to Jim, Son of the Beach, Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man, Second Noah, Normal Life, etc.</p><p>Likewise, Dweezil has also appeared in a reality show, Celebrity Wife Swap, alongside his wife <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Megan Marsicano</strong></a> and stepdaughter <strong>Mia Marsicano</strong>. Some other acting credits include Mother Foose Rock ‘n’ Rhyme, The Running Man, Pretty in Pink, etc. Also, Dweezil has lent his voice for Gary Shostotonovonovich of The Oracle of Outer Space.</p><p>The average salary of a movie star is $90,500, while a tv actor makes an average of $32,500 per year. However, the pay varies with the experience, knowledge, and skill of an individual.</p><p>Therefore, Dweezil Zappa’s fortune increased along with his acting career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dweezil_Zappas_House_In_Toluca></span>Dweezil Zappa’s House In Toluca<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Dweezil’s wealth has doubled massively since 1986. Hence, he is undoubtedly leading a luxurious life.</p><p>The rock guitarist currently lives in his Toluca home with his wife, Megan, and kid Mia. Furthermore, he bought the 2,221 sq. ft house in 2006 for $1.457 million. He also enjoys his time with daughters&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Zola Frank Zappa</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Ceylon Indira Zappa</strong></a> here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dweezil-Zappa-net-worth-is-1-million.jpg><p>Also, the Zappa couple swapped his wife with <strong>David Justice</strong>‘s wife, <strong>Rebecca Justice</strong>, for a show, Celebrity Wife Swap. The show gave a peek into the rock guitarist’s lifestyle, which was pretty mellow for the musician.</p><p>However, the Zappa couple indeed has a healthy living standard and basic human courtesy to one another. While Dweezil lives a comfortable yet luxurious life, his father, Frank Zappa’s house, was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">bought by</a> <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> for $5.25 million.</p><p>Frank had bought the property for around $75,000 in the mid-70s and spent his entire time there. Moreover, today, Frank Zappa’s net worth is estimated at $1 million on his deathbed. Therefore, Dweezil is more affluent than his father and continues to proliferate.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
