Another area in which the country singer stands heads and shoulders above his colleagues is his career achievements. Since dropping his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015, Wallen has risen to become one of the biggest superstars in country music. He has released multiple platinum albums and his music has been streamed about four billion times.</p><p>He has also headlined several sold-out tours and in February 2021, his second album, Dangerous, became the first country album to top the Billboard 200 for seven weeks. Wallen has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top but this was nearly <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>derailed</a> when he was filmed using racial slurs in February 2021. This caused several radio stations to drop his music but he is bouncing back again.</p><h4><strong>Summary of Morgan Wallen’s Body Measurements</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Morgan Cole Wallen</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Morgan</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 13th of May 1993</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Age: </strong>30</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign: </strong>Taurus</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> straight</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 10 ½ inches</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 179 cm</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Weight:</strong> 150 lbs (68 kg)</li><li><strong>Biceps size:</strong> 15 inches (38 cm)</li><li><strong>Chest size:</strong> 50 inches (127 cm)</li><li><strong>Waist size:</strong> 32 inches (81 cm)</li><li><strong>Hip size:</strong> 31 inches (78 cm)</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s hair color:</strong> auburn</li><li><strong>Eye color:</strong> brown</li><li><strong>Tattoos:</strong> none</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall is Morgan Wallen?</strong></h2><p>Morgan Wallen is 5 feet 10 ½ inches (179 cm) tall. The singer is taller than the average guy out there and this is confirmed by statistics.

He supported Combs on the latter’s Beer Never Broke My Heart Tour of 2019. In turn, Combs gifted him a precious piece of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>music history</a> in the form of a rare and expensive guitar. We can definitely expect more collaborations from these two in the future. While we wait for that to happen, Luke Combs is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73m) tall which means that Morgan Wallen is two and a half-inch taller than him.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Morgan Wallen Compared to HARDY?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Morgan-Wallen-1.jpg><p>Another long-time collaborator of Morgan Wallen’s is HARDY.

HARDY has also penned several songs for Morgan Wallen and joined Wallen on stage during the NYC leg of his Dangerous Tour in February 2022. The two gave an exhilarating performance that blew the minds of fans. Their height would have been of little importance then but if anybody bothered to check they would discover that Morgan Wallen is two and a half-inch taller than HARDY who is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73m) tall.</p><h3><strong>Riley Green is Taller Than Morgan Wallen</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Morgan-Wallen-2.jpg><p>One of the few country music stars that can boast of being taller than Morgan Wallen is Riley Green. Before finding fame as a singer, Riley Green variously played college football and contested on reality TV.

This makes him five and a half-inch taller than Morgan Wallen.</p><h2><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Weight and Workout Routine</strong></h2><p>Morgan Wallen’s weight is put at 68 kg or 150 lbs.
