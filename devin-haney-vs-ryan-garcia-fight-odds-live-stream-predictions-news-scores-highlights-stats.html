The 25-year-old came in 3.2 pounds overweight but honored a press conference bet that he would pay Haney $500,000 for each pound he was overweight, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Benson</a> of talkSPORT.</p><p>With Haney adding another $1.5 million to his winnings, the fight will move forward as a non-title fight.</p><p>Here's a look at all you need to catch the fight, a preview and prediction for who will get his hand raised.</p><p><b><u>Fight Info, Odds</u></b></p><p><b>When: </b>Saturday, April 20 at 8 p.m. ET (main event ringwalks at approximately 11 p.m. ET)</p><p><b>Where: </b>Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York</p><p><b>Odds: </b>Haney -800 (wager $800 to win $100); Garcia +550 (wager $100 to win $550)</p><p>Haney will look to defend his crown for the first time since he won it against Regis Prograis back in December. After dominating in the lightweight division, he put on a dominant performance against Prograis.</p><p>Garcia is still working his way back from his loss to Gervonta Davis a year ago. He knocked out Oscar Duarte in a December 2023 fight, but this is his first big fight back.</p><p>As the odds would indicate, Haney is a big favorite in this win. That's to be expected. Both fighters might have star power and the ability to draw attention but only one of them is a world champion with an undefeated record.</p><p>Garcia's skills of self-promotion have allowed him to build up an audience. However, he's fighting a battle to prove that his boxing skills are commensurate with those promotional chops.</p><p>He came up short in his last opportunity to do that. Fighting a former world lightweight champion in Davis, he could have launched his stardom to the next level. He was able to have limited success early in the fight, but he never found a home for his signature left hook and was flattened when Davis was able to counter with his own power shots.</p><p>Haney is a much different challenge than Davis. He brings a different level of ringcraft and movement that he intends to use to neutralize Garcia's biggest advantage.</p><p>"Ryan Garcia has power of course, but Regis Prograis had power, Linares had power, a lot of these guys had power," Haney told <a href=# rel=noopener>DAZN's Off the Cuff</a> (h/t <a href=# rel=noopener>Matt Astbury</a> of DAZN.com). "I'm just on a different level, so he can bring all the power he wants, I'm going to bring the skills, the IQ that I've got and handicap him of his power."</p><p>Garcia isn't short on confidence either. He obviously wants the fight after paying out $1.5 million just to make sure it still went down after his failure at the scale. He believes he can thrive where previous Haney opponents have failed.</p><p>"You've got to have no mercy on Devin, that's the problem Lomachenko had, Regis is just not a good fighter, he's still amateur in my opinion, the way he fights. He started late and it's showing that he started late," Garcia told <a href=# rel=noopener>DAZN</a>.</p><p><b>Prediction</b></p><p>Garcia might not lack confidence, but he does lack the skills to pull off this upset. He has a puncher's chance. His ability to deliver power with his sharp left hook has been a significant part of his rise in the boxing world.</p><p>However, we've seen what it's like when he tries bringing that power to an opponent who is at the top of the game. The real scary thing for Garcia is that Haney is a better pure boxer than Davis.</p><p>The risk of getting knocked out is less. Haney doesn't have the same devastating stopping power that powers Tank. But the odds that he gets outclassed from pillar to post are greater.</p><p>Expect Haney to shine in one of the brightest moments of his career to date.</p><p><b>Haney via unanimous decision</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyDeH2MnZyvoZ5itaK6xLJkr6tdp8aiuoygmKubmZZ6p7XGoatmp5SZwG64yK%2BcZqukp7KiuYypqZ6cmZjBqrvNrA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./directioners-launch-wearemadeintheam-campaign-celebmix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Directioners launch #WeAreMadeInTheAM campaign - CelebMix">&larr;
