Peter Sawkins, the 2020 champion, says he ‘audibly squealed’ when he received the box, which has also been praised by 2020 finalist Laura Adlington, and 2018 winner Rahul Mandal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So does it live up to the hype? As a lifelong baker who has even made a cake for Mary Berry, I’ve got high expectations to say the least.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To put the recipes to the test, I’m sent three sample boxes. And when they arrive at my door, bearing that familiar logo, it feels as comforting as an old friend.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">CHOCOLATE CAKE</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>First up is a signature chocolate cake, swirled with ganache and covered with fresh raspberries, which eagle-eyed fans will recognise from the opening credits of the series.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the box contains dry ingredients and the recipe, you’ll need your own baking equipment: cake tins, greaseproof paper, wooden spoons, a whisk and weighing scales are a must.</p><img decoding=async id=i-33253047aaaba01b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606140-9373511-image-a-5_1616016765752.jpg height=421 width=634 alt="Sarah admits she was disappointed by the long list of extra ingredients she had to source herself to make chocolate cake" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-33253047aaaba01b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606140-9373511-image-a-5_1616016765752.jpg height=421 width=634 alt="Sarah admits she was disappointed by the long list of extra ingredients she had to source herself to make chocolate cake" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Sarah admits she was disappointed by the long list of extra ingredients she had to source herself to make chocolate cake&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The recipe looks straightforward, and there’s a nice bamboo cake stand included in the box, but I’m disappointed at the long list of extra ingredients I have to source myself — milk, oil, eggs, butter, cream and raspberries — which comes to more than £10.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All that’s in the box is a ‘flour sachet’ containing weighed-out flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda, some caster sugar, cocoa powder and chocolate drops, which seems a bit mean.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I start by lining two cake tins, mixing the dry and wet ingredients and then baking the sponge for 35 minutes. Once cooled, I make a ganache — otherwise known as thick icing — from cream and chocolate, and swirl this over the top and sides in an artistic fashion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All that’s left is to top the cake with raspberries — the recipe says 300g, but I need far more — and marvel at my mouth-watering creation. I last about 30 seconds before digging in.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It tastes utterly delicious: moist, melt-in-the-mouth sponge with an indulgent topping.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">BANANA LOAVES</span></p><img decoding=async id=i-d974349c8ed49ce8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606164-9373511-image-a-3_1616016731751.jpg height=395 width=634 alt="Sarah said her banana loaves didn't look as pretty as the ones in the photographs, but were full of fruity flavour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-d974349c8ed49ce8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606164-9373511-image-a-3_1616016731751.jpg height=395 width=634 alt="Sarah said her banana loaves didn't look as pretty as the ones in the photographs, but were full of fruity flavour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Sarah said her banana loaves didn’t look as pretty as the ones in the photographs, but were full of fruity flavour&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While many home bakers might have had their fill of banana bread from the first lockdown, the second box contains the ingredients you will need for a batch of miniature banana and walnut loaves. I get sugar, a flour sachet, icing sugar, dried banana chips and walnuts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The box creators have also included a silicone tray, which is handy if, like me, you don’t have cupboards full of equipment. This time there aren’t nearly as many extra ingredients for my shopping list — just bananas, butter and eggs — and I get started by mashing the bananas and whisking in the rest of the ingredients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are clear, concise instructions and overhead photographs to show what’s going on in the bowl at each stage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Once baked in the oven for 30 minutes, the loaves are easy to pop out of the moulds and I let them cool before topping with buttercream and decorating with chopped nuts and banana chips. Mine don’t look half as pretty as the ones in the pictures, but they’re full of fruity flavour.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">LEMON SLICES</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This recipe is for the sort of classic, homely bake Mary Berry would approve of. And although it looks tasty, it’s a little simple for me — I don’t need an expensive subscription to teach me to make a traybake.</p><img decoding=async id=i-84ea319cdb1a3e50 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606170-9373511-image-a-4_1616016752573.jpg height=411 width=634 alt="Sarah said the recipe options are all reasonably bland, boring cakes that aren't great for those with more ambition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-84ea319cdb1a3e50 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/17/21/40606170-9373511-image-a-4_1616016752573.jpg height=411 width=634 alt="Sarah said the recipe options are all reasonably bland, boring cakes that aren't great for those with more ambition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Sarah said the recipe options are all reasonably bland, boring cakes that aren’t great for those with more ambition&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The box contains flour, sugar, fondant icing, a pot of lemon curd and candied lemon slices. I stock up on butter, eggs and milk, whisk the sponge ingredients together and use the zester included to grate peel from two lemons. It’s quite a nifty gadget (a similar one at John Lewis is £15), so I feel like I’m getting my money’s worth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the sponge bakes, I make a lemony syrup, followed by fondant icing, both of which go on top of the cooled traybake. All that’s left is a few flourishes with some candied lemon slices (also included), and my bake is done. Sharp and sweet, with a crumbly sponge and thick oozy icing, I can’t deny they taste good — but this one’s a bit basic for a Hollywood handshake.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">THE VERDICT</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the Bake Off Box does exactly what it says on the tin by offering simple, speedy and tasty recipes for home bakes, what’s sorely missing is the creativity from the Bake Off contestants, who sadly seem to have had no input in the boxes’ content.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We fans would have relished the opportunity to recreate the dazzling illusion cakes from series eight, or to attempt Nancy’s amazing windmill cake from series five.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Instead, the options are all reasonably bland, boring cakes — presumably intended to appeal to all ages and abilities — but not great for those of us with a little more ambition. Saying that, at a time when we could all do with a bit of cheering up, a delivery of baking essentials to your door each month is a lovely treat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Is it worth £19.99 a pop? Probably not, but at least you can bake your way out of boredom. And as you still can’t invite friends and family over yet . . . there’s no option but to eat all the cakes yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>BAKE IT YOURSELF KITS: BEST OF THE REST</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">BOOZY DELIGHTS</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>The BakedIn Baking Club, from £7.50 a month or £10 one-off, bakedin.co.uk</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ideal for grown-up bakers, try your hand at mojito or espresso martini cupcakes with this postal kit.
