Who is Dwight Yoakam dating now & how much money does Dwight Yoakam have?</p><h2>Dwight Yoakam Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Dwight Yoakam</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Country Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>October 23, 1956</strong> in Pikeville, Kentucky, <strong>United States</strong>. Country singer, songwriter, actor, and director whose debut EP was Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. He has had more than thirty singles land on the US Country charts, along with 12 gold albums and 9 platinum albums.</p><p>Before he was famous, he used to perform impersonations of famous people like <a href=#>Richard Nixon</a>.</p><p>Dwight David Yoakam (born October 23, 1956) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and actor, known for his pioneering style of country music. First becoming popular in the mid-1980s, Yoakam has recorded more than twenty albums and compilations, charted more than thirty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and sold more than 30 million records. He has recorded five Billboard No. 1 albums, twelve gold albums, and nine platinum albums, including the triple-platinum This Time.</p><p>Not making much headway in Nashville, Yoakam moved to Los Angeles and worked towards bringing his particular brand of new Honky Tonk or “Hillbilly” music (as he called it) forward into the 1980s. Writing all his own songs, and continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, he did many shows in rock and punk rock clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like The Blasters (Yoakam scored a small video hit with his version of their song “Long White Cadillac”), Los Lobos, and X. This helped him diversify his audience beyond the typical country music fans, and his authentic, honky-tonk revivalism brought rock audiences closer to country music.</p><p align=justify>He was born the son of Ruth Ann, who was a key-punch operator, and David Yoakam, a gas-station owner.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dwight Yoakam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dwight</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yoakam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pikeville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kentucky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ruth Ann Yoakam, David Yoakam</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dwight Yoakam ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Chris Isaak called him as good a songwriter as ever put a pen to paper. Time dubbed him “A Renaissance Man” and Vanity Fair declared that “Yoakam strides the divide between rock’s lust and country’s lament.” Along with his bluegrass and honky-tonk roots, he has written or covered many Elvis Presley-style rockabilly songs, including his covers of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” in 1999 and Presley’s “Suspicious Minds” in 1992. He recorded a cover of The Clash’s “Train in Vain” in 1997, a cover of the Grateful Dead song “Truckin'”, as well as Cheap Trick’s “I Want You to Want Me”. He has never been associated only with country music; on many early tours, he played with hardcore punk bands like Hüsker Dü, and played many shows around Los Angeles with roots/punk/rock & roll acts. His middle-period-to-later records saw him branching out to different styles, covering rock & roll, punk, 1960’s, blues-based “boogie” like ZZ Top, and writing more adventurous songs like “A Thousand Miles From Nowhere”.

The record hit the market during a sea change in country music: the urban cowboy music was out of style, and neotraditional music based on classic styles, such as Yoakam’s honky-tonk inspired music, was now in demand. The LP was a breakout hit and spawned his first two hit singles: “Honky Tonk Man”, a remake of the Johnny Horton song, and the title track “Guitars, Cadillacs.” His stylish video “Honky Tonk Man” was the first country music video ever played on MTV.
