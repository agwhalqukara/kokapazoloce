The writer was incoherent, “in great distress,” and wearing the clothes of another man.<p>These facts lead many to believe that Poe had been a victim of cooping (depicted here), a common practice of the time where unwilling people were taken from the streets, intoxicated or drugged, then taken from one polling location to another to manipulate the vote for a certain candidate.</p><p>The writer was taken to Washington Medical College where he would die four days later.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <img alt="Poe Plaque" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/poe-plaque.jpg> <span class=caption-body>There are many theories as to the true cause of Edgar Allan Poe’s death, but no one really knows the circumstances of the poet’s demise.
