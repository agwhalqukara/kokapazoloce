The two find themselves getting closer to the hazy nebula of a midlife crisis as they reunite after a protracted separation. But despite their predicament, the two closest friends are able to mend their relationship and get over their own obstacles. There are comedic moments and hilariously surprising scenarios throughout their reunion. A deep poignancy also emerges as the two set out to conquer obstacles and get through life with each other’s support.</p><p>The Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco-created Apple TV+ production focuses on the platonic relationship between two closest friends. Rose Byrne, Seth Rogen, Luke Macfarlane, Tre Hale, Carla Gallo, Andrew Lopez, Alisha Wainwright, and Vinny Thomas all give strong performances in the series. So, if you like the comedy television programme “Platonic” as much as we did, here is a list of related programmes. Several of these programmes, including “Platonic,” are available on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>Broad City (2014-2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BroadCity-scaled-1.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=512 height=342 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Broad City’ tells the tale of two women, Ilana and Abbi, and their struggle to’make it’ in New York. The cast of the show includes Hannibal Buress, Paul W. Downs, Arturo Castro, Abbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, and Abbi Jacobson. Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, the show’s creators, based their real-life friendships and experiences on them.</p><p>The one thing the women always have as they face a variety of difficulties, everyday occurrences, and hilarious scenarios in the Big Apple is one another. This is the appropriate show to watch next because the duo’s bawdy demeanour and distinctive qualities are just as intriguing and novel as Sylvia and Will’s dysfunctional craziness in “Platonic.”</p><h3>Firefly Lane (2021-2023)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Firefly-Lane-9-SS.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=501 height=331 sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This television show, which is based on a book, shows how special friendships serve as each other’s support system as well as a shoulder to weep on. The television show centres on Kate and Tully, two closest friends who have endured years of adversity, suffering, and rage. ‘Firefly Lane’ vividly illustrates the sustaining power of friendship by telling their narrative from 1974 to thirty years later.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u9009dfc01f8692154dc6c4bd28765fe9><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Shows You'd Enjoy If You Liked Paramount’s Wolf Pack</span></a><p>Sarah Chalke, Katherine Heigl, Ben Lawson, Alissa Skovbye, Roan Curtis, and Beau Garrett all appear in the series. So, if you enjoyed watching Sylvia and Will’s unrestrained relationship in “Platonic,” you’ll enjoy “Firefly Lane,” which was created by Maggie Friedman, just as much.</p><h3>Fleishman Is in Trouble (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fleishman-is-in-trouble-1014x570-1.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=453 height=251 sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Fleishman Is in Trouble” chronicles the story of Toby Fleishman, a Jewish hepatologist in New York who joins a hookup dating app and begins having casual hookups after divorcing his wife of 15 years as it heads towards a crisis. Lizzy Caplan, Claire Danes, Jesse Eisenberg, Adam Brody, Josh Radnor, and Christian Slater all give strong performances that enhance the story.</p><p>The Taffy Brodesser-Akner-created programme focuses on the allure of human nature. There are many humorous and challenging scenarios that arise as the main character deals with life’s major decisions. Therefore, “Fleishman Is in Trouble” is a similarly sombre play about life. If you liked “Platonic” for its startlingly realistic premise, you’ll like “Fleishman Is in Trouble.”</p><h3>Glow (2017-2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/glow-1.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 1980s are the setting for the series, which was conceived by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch. The story revolves around ladies who compete in GLOW, or the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, a 1980s-era syndicated women’s professional wrestling circuit. The women in GLOW embrace the various hurdles put in their path with their disparate characteristics. Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Sydelle Noel, Chris Lowell, Marc Maron, Sunita Mani, and Kate Nash are among the cast members. So, if you liked Sylvia and Will’s friendship and support for one another in “Platonic,” you’ll like this comedy series just as much.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf7f5b29ecc49071c885f5784874f1b43><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Serial Killers From Movies & TV Shows We Actually Kind of Loved</span></a><h3>Grace and Frankie (2015-2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/grace-and-frankie.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=445 height=250 sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Grace and Frankie’ is a television series that Marta Kauffman and Howard J. Morris created. It tells the tale of two older ladies who, by an odd turn of events, wind up becoming friends. Grace Hanson and Frankie Bergstein are thrust into a number of amusing scenarios after learning that their respective spouses are in love with one another and intend to wed.</p><p>The show’s namesake characters are played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, together with Sam Waterston, June Diane Raphael, Martin Sheen, Ethan Embry, and Baron Vaughn. Therefore, if you like the unusually dysfunctional connection between Will and Sylvia, you’ll enjoy the friendship in “Grace and Frankie” just as much.</p><h3></h3><h3>Julia (2022-)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/julia-tv-review-2022.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=512 height=341 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Julia meets a doctor in her early fifties and learns about the affects of menopause. She realises the opportunities she could take advantage of are right there as she retreats into her cocoon. Julia Child’s ascent to fame as a writer and TV chef is followed throughout the programme. The series was created by Daniel Goldfarb and stars Sarah Lancashire, David Hyde Pierce, Fiona Glascott, and Brittany Bradford.</p><p>Julia’s life is not without its challenges, just as Will and Sylvia, who are dealing with a variety of interpersonal and romantic problems. So, if you liked seeing Sylvia and Will grow in “Platonic,” you’ll like this fictionalised account of the real-life star, whose evolution continues to serve as an example for many people.</p><h3>The Kominsky Method (2018-2021)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Kominsky-Method.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=500 height=282 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Chuck Lorre-written sitcom, which stars Michael Douglas, Alan Arkin, Sarah Baker, Paul Reiser, Kathleen Turner, Melissa Tang, and Graham Rogers, goes above and beyond the chuckles it should provide. The Kominsky Method, which centres on the story of an actor who became an acting coach and his best friend, an agent, also captures the painful suffering that people must endure in life.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub6cb09d3ae2635f291a9186a54eb6674><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Physical Fitness Meets Reality TV: 8 Shows Like Physical 100</span></a><p>The characters struggle and make decisions about their interpersonal relationships. So ‘The Kominsky Method’ will be the ideal show for you to binge next because it is somewhat similar to Sylvia and Will’s trip in ‘Platonic’.</p><h3>Younger (2015-2021)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/younger-1.jpg alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" width=500 height=281 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The narrative of Liza, a single mother of 40 who accidentally appears younger than she actually is, is told in the movie “Younger,” which serves as an example that not all mistakes are harmful. The opportunity to restart her job and give her love life another shot comes next. Sutton Foster, Nico Tortorella, Hilary Duff, Peter Hermann, Miriam Shor, Molly Kate Bernard, Debi Mazar, Phoebe Dynevor, and Charles Michael Davis make up the cast of the programme. This show is the ideal one to watch following “Platonic” because it imagines the possibilities of transformation and revived optimism. It was created by Darren Star.</p><h3></h3><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="shows like platonic friendship,shows like platonic relationships,shows like platonic romance,shows like poker face reddit,shows like columbo,best whodunit shows,serial killer shows,serial killer movies and shows,shows like friends on netflix,shows like panchayat,series like please like me,shows like friends,shows like splitsvilla on netflix" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
