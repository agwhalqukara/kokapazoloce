Born on the 20th of October 1979, he is the youngest child of Mary Clare and her husband, Ronald Krasinski.</p><p>An alum of Brown University, Violet Krasinski’s father studied theatre arts during his days at the National Theatre Institute. He later moved to New York to launch a career in acting and recorded his breakthrough on the set of the TV series known as The Office.</p><p>Before his big break, John was very active in TV commercials and was participating in readings on several off-Broadway plays.

John met Emily and the said friend having a meal at a restaurant and one thing led to another, and according to Violet Krasinski’s dad, it was love at first sight for him.</p><p>By November of 2008, they went on their first date and in August 2009, John was already on bended knee asking for Emily’s hand in marriage. The actor’s marriage proposal reduced the two of them to tears and the moment got so emotional that other people in the restaurant joined in shedding tears of joy.</p><p>The celebrity duo eventually said “Yes I do” in July 2010 and their wedding ceremony was hosted in Lake Como, Italy, at a mansion belonging to entertainment giant, George Clooney.</p><h3><strong>Violet Krasinski has One Big Sister</strong></h3><p>Before Violet Krasinski was born, Emily and John were already first-time parents to Hazel Krasinski. Hazel was born two years earlier on February 16th, 2014, and John took to Twitter to announce her birth.</p><p>The proud parents had a baby shower in December in anticipation of Hazel’s birth and prior to that, they announced the pregnancy sometime in September 2013. Three months after her birth, John unveiled his first daughter’s face on Twitter saying children’s pictures ought to come from their parents alone.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pics of kids should only come direct from parents. So I'm thrilled to introduce you guys to Hazel!!! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#NoKidsPolicy</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qVvUTRdllP</a></p><p>— John Krasinski (@johnkrasinski) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2014</a></p><h2><strong>Violet Krasinski Has an Ear for Music</strong></h2><p>John and Emily have revealed that they would not like their children to follow the same career path as them.

There is also a recording where little Violet was spotted singing jingle bells.</p><h2><strong>Violet Krasinski Shares a Great Bond with Her parents</strong></h2><p>Though John and Emily try their utmost best to keep their children as far away from the limelight as possible, it is glaring that they love their daughters to distraction.</p><p>John is always talking about Violet and her big sister whenever he makes public appearances. The Office alum was on the set of Saturday Night Live as the host when he sent his girls a heartwarming shout-out wearing a black crew neck sweater sporting “H + V” for Hazel and Violet.</p><p>On her own part, Emily has said she wants her daughters to have a normal life and not feel special because of who their parents are. According to the Devil Wears Prada alum, her home is a zoo right now but she has learned to take each day as they come. Emily is just besotted with her girls and has been severally spotted with them out and about town.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMOqu8ueq2ajopbAqrrSpKBmmpmktLOtz6GwZpmemXqxsdGspqeZnGK5qrLEZqafZZWitq3FjJujrqakqHq0scKopZ1lk522rbCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-illness-does-paul-silas-die-of-death-cause-and-obituary-did-he-die-of-cancer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Illness Does Paul Silas Die Of?
