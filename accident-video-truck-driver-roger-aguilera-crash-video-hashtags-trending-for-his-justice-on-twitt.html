Accident Video</h2><p>Roger Aguilera got into a horrific road accident in April 2019 and the accident video has been popular over the internet.</p><p>He ran his trailer truck into 28 different vehicles which were lined up ahead of him in the traffic on Highway 70 at Denver, Colorado.</p><p>This accident caused the immediate death of 4 people on the spot and several others were injured who were later taken to hospital.</p><p>Roger gave his statement claiming that the accident took place because he lost control over the brakes of the truck as they were broken.</p><p>But unfortunately, he has to spend the rest of a century in prison for the crime he has committed as proven by the court on December 13.</p><p>Roger Aguilera has been sentenced to 110 ten years of prison and the hashtags of the justice for Roger has been trending on Twitter.</p><p>After the sentence was announced, several human rights activists as well as the association of truck drivers began raising their voices about this injustice.</p><p>And they started expressing their concern through the help of a popular social media site, Twitter, by sharing the tweets using #JusticeforRoger.</p><p>Within a short span of time, this hashtag has become successful among people as they have been tweeting and sharing it rapidly over the internet.</p><h2 id=who-is-roger-aguilera>Who Is Roger Aguilera?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bigworldfree4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/d25fce10-5cdb-11ec-bea1-adb1dc4a74f2_800_420_11zon-665x349.jpg><p>Roger Aguilera is a truck driver originally from Cuba who came to the United States in the year 2015 and has been working there since then.</p><p>He currently is 26 years old and has been at a very young and energetic age and has been feeling incredibly guilty about what had happened 2 years ago.</p><p>According to the report presented on the court, he has a wife and a child and was living a happy life with his family until this mishappening took place.</p><p>After the judge announced his verdict, he burst into the tears begging for mercy although the legal punishment for his act was accurate according to attornies.</p><h2 id=exacc_slO8YaDQH7eK9u8PqvyZoAk79 class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf">Why was Rogel Aguilera-Mederos sentenced to 110 years?</h2><p><span class=ILfuVd><span class=hgKElc>Rogel Aguilera-Mederos was sentenced to 110 years in prison on Dec. 13 after&nbsp;<b>a jury found him guilty on 42 counts</b>, including vehicular homicide, first-degree assault, attempted first-degree assault, vehicular assault, reckless driving and careless driving.</span></span></p><p>More than 2 million people have signed&nbsp;<u><a class=Link href=#>an online petition</a></u>&nbsp;calling for a change to the sentence given to the truck driver who caused a deadly, fiery crash on I-70 in&nbsp;<u><a class=Link href=#>April 2019</a></u>.</p><p>Rogel Aguilera-Mederos&nbsp;<u>was sentenced to 110 years in prison</u>&nbsp;on Dec. 13 after a jury&nbsp;<u>found him guilty</u>&nbsp;on 42 counts, including vehicular homicide, first-degree assault, attempted first-degree assault, vehicular assault, reckless driving and careless driving.</p><p>Judge A. Bruce Jones said his hands were tied when it came to sentencing because of mandatory minimum laws in the state.</p><p>Domingo Garcia, the national president of LULAC, a Latino civil rights organization, says they’re backing the petition, calling the sentence an injustice.</p><p>“This case is so egregious,” Garcia said. “It boggles the mind that here we are in 2021 and that somebody who was not intoxicated, not on drugs… It’s an accident, the brakes went out. But here’s the Latino driver, he gets charged, convicted and given 110 years of prison on his first offense.”</p><p>Garcia said it’s not the jury who convicted him, but Jefferson County District Attorney Alexis King because of the charges she chose to file against Aguilera-Mederos. He believes they can file charges with the Colorado Bar Association “to see if she abused her authority.”</p><p>“We can ask for a grand jury to be convened to look at official oppression,” Garcia said. “We’re going to ask the Department of Justice to come and investigate the district attorney’s office to see if white defendants are treated different from Black and brown defendants and if there is a pattern and system of practice of just justice and racism discrimination in that district attorney’s office.”</p><p>In response, King provided the following statement:</p><p>“This tragedy was devastating to the victims, their families and our entire community. The actions and decisions of Mr. Aguilera-Mederos resulted in the loss of four lives, devastating injuries to the survivors and – as we heard them state during the sentencing hearing – grave impacts to their families and loved ones. We initiated plea negotiations but Mr. Aguilera-Mederos declined to consider anything other than a traffic ticket. The facts and consequences of his decisions that day were extraordinary enough to support pursuing first-degree assault charges. Ethically, we do not – nor can we – pick and choose between victims in charging. The jury’s thoughtful verdict reflects the strength of the evidence presented and recognizes the harm caused to the victims. The sentence – which our office requested the minimum for – is within the purview of the court and reflects the judgment of the legislature. Just as the law mandates this outcome, it also provides future opportunity to revisit the sentence, and we will again pursue an appropriate outcome if that opportunity arises, after consulting with the victims and survivors and receiving their input.”</p><p>Garcia said the reason Aguilera-Mederos did not agree to a plea deal is because he believed he was innocent.</p><p>Garcia says he is also calling on Gov. Jared Polis to intervene.</p><p>Four people died in the fiery crash that involved 28 vehicles on April 25, 2019. Aguilera-Mederos told police he lost control of his brakes while driving a semi-truck hauling lumber on eastbound I-70. He drove onto the shoulder and crashed into traffic at the Colorado Mills Parkway overpass. He was going at least 85 miles per hour just before the crash, according to police.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m%2Ftq%2FKZpuroaaav26%2BzqCcq2WRnMKquMSrmGabopbAqXnVopuep18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./experts-applaud-launch-of-988-mental-health-crisis-hotline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Experts applaud launch of 988 mental health crisis hotline">&larr;
